Media Portal is a free and open source computer application which works on Windows systems as well as on Mac.

If you need to show a group of images or videos during a video conference and you're using the screen sharing feature, Media Portal helps you to prepare a list of files from which you'll send content with a single click.

## User manual

When Media Portal is ran, two windows are open: one of them is the management one, the other window is the one in which content is going to be seen.

Now we only need to select and drag our list of image or video files into the management window.

Then, we click any of them and we'll immediately see the content on the portal.

Be it an image...

It's just that simple, you can start to use Media Portal now!

## FAQ

### Can I use it with multiple displays?
If you have two or more displays, you can move the portal to any of them and even go fullscreen by double-clicking it. This can be handy if you want to share an entire screen to your video conferences application.

### What are those green flags at the left side?
To keep track of what has been already shared during the conference, Media Portal will automatically flag every file when selected. This way you'll always know what's the next one. You also can manually add or remove those flags by clicking on them.

### Are there any keyboard shortcuts?
Indeed, for the most demanding ones, Media Portal offers the possibility to control sending content through keyboard shortcuts. Something pretty convenient considering that the most common scenario on a video conference implies being more focused on the video conference software itself, so there may not be time to be switching between windows.

| Keyboard shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> | Send next content |
| <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>0</kbd> | Stop sending current content |
| <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>[1-9]</kbd> | Send content on desired position |
